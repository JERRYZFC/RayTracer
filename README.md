# RayTracer
A ray tracing program

Mainly based on 'Ray Tracing' books from Peter Shirley: http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html

But not only, info coming soon on the Computational Physics Blog: https://compphys.go.ro

Some papers that were used:

'An Anisotropic Phong BRDF Model' by Michael Ashikhmin and Peter Shirley
https://www.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/papers/jgtbrdf.pdf

Osada et All, 'Shape Distributions'
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~funk/tog02.pdf

'Fast, minimum storage ray-triangle intersection'
Tomas MÃ¶ller and Ben Trumbore. 
Journal of Graphics Tools, 2(1):21--28, 1997. 
http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/pubs/1997/MT97.pdf

The project has some known issues, for example loading an object from an obj file does not split correctly concave polygons, they must be convex.
Also importance sampling with composite objects has some issues. I know why they occur and how it could be solved, but I don't have enough patience for those changes right now :)


Some images obtained while implementing it:
